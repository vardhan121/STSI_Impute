### STSI-Impute: A Spatio-Temporal and Statistical Imputation Framework with Attention-Based Forecasting for Air Quality Prediction


Supplementary Figures for STSI-Impute Paper

This repository contains the supplementary comparison plots of ground-truth vs. predicted PM2.5 values for 12 experimental setups.

The folder attention contains the comparision plots of Additive Attention Model and Multi-head_Attention folder comprises of comparision plots of Multi-Head Self Attention Model

Each figure corresponds to a specific combination of:

Model: Additive Attention / Transformer (Multi-Head Self-Attention)

Window size (Î”t): 12 hours or 24 hours

Forecast horizon (â„“): 1, 12, or 24 hours ahead
